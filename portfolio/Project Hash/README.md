# Project Hash

***

This project was from a previous project in the Data Structures course. 

My instructor gave us a code that would not compile and I ended up fixing it myself and sharing with the class. We all had the same issue
and got the same errors when we would try to compile. 

This project is supposed to read and perform each hash and time how long each hash takes to complete, given a number of items.

In this folder you will find:
1. My main file
2. 4 headers that include:
   - My hash code
   - My partner's hash code
   - A complexity timer
   - A complexity recorder

_This project took me over a week to debug and compile without my intructors help. His code that he gave us was completely broken_
